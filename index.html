    <p>I earned a B.S. and M.Eng at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> studying Computer Science. I currently live in Seattle, Washington.</p>

    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I have worked with a wide variety of technologies in computer graphics, video games, the semantic web, embedded systems, databases, large-scale information systems, online transactions, computer security, natural language processing, and machine learning. Below are a few things I've made for school, business, and pleasure.</p>

The Cornell Legal Information Institute uses this tool as the basis for other legal linked data applications.</p>
